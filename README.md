# Enterprise Network Architecture: Istanbul - Izmır WAN Design

This project simulates a secure, scalable and hierarchical network infrastructure between two geographically separated branches (**Istanbul HQ** and **Izmir Branch**) using **Cisco Packet Tracer**

**VLAN & Trunking:** Network isolation based on departments (Management, Finance, Warehouse, Logistics).
**Router-on-a-Stick:** Implementation of Inter-VLAN routing using 802.1Q encapsulation.
**WAN Connectivity:** Serial connection between Istanbul and Izmir routers.
**Static Routing:** Configuration of routing tables for seamless branch-to-branch communication.
**Port Security:** Access and Trunk mode configurations on switches.

Download the `.pkt` file from this repository.
Open the file using **Cisco Packet Tracer** (v8.0 or later).
Switch to **Simulation Mode** to visualize packet flow or use the command line to ping between PC terminals (e.g., from *Istanbul-Finance* to *Izmir-Logistics*).

*This project was developed for the Computer Network Systems course.*
